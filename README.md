## Meet-in-the-middle Program

Find it difficult to find songs that you and your friend both enjoy? This program should be the fix to that!
Currently working on a full-stack project in order to develop a program that leverages k-means++ in order to group songs into clusters. Then, users should be able to input two lists of (differing) songs. This is fed into the algorithm and returns a list of songs that both users should ideally be able to enjoy.
